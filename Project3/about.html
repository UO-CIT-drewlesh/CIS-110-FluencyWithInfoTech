        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="about-page">
            At Countryside Pizza & Grill, our goal is to create a warm atmosphere for regulars and newcomers. 
            We make our pizza dough and pizza sauce fresh everyday, and dish out some of the tasiest pizza in the area. 
            With dine in, takeout, or delivery through GrubHub, our food is ready to be served. 
            We certainly hope to see you soon!

            It's important for us as a community to support each other, especially in hard times like COVID. 
            So, we get our bread products from the local bakery right next door! 
            They make their bread and baked products to perfection, with warm and fluffy burger buns, to amazing sourdough bread. 
            It allows us to support our neighbors' business while, in turn, getting the amazing bread for our dishes.
